## Malayalam keyboard for typing as if Romanized
In a recent discussion on the Nalla Malayalam Facebook Community some members expressed the need of an IME for the Windows platform. The tools that were formally used were either become obsolute or changed into paid software. This requirement was reported to the InKey development team. Hence we created an InKey keyboard based the Mozhi Keyboard Layout.

You must install the InKey (www.inkeysoftware.com/download.html) before installing a keyboard.
